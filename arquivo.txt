Hi Class,
I have been teaching here at BYU-Idaho for 
7 semesters and I have enjoyed my time here. 
However, I also have been teaching at Cal State Long Beach in Long Beach,
California since 1991 - that's almost 30 years! During my time of teaching,
I have probably met and taught close to 5000 students. I believe, and have observed,
that most students genuinely want to learn and show academic integrity. 
However, I have had to deal with some students who were dishonest in submitting programs or taking tests or quizzes. 
These students seemed only interested in getting a good grade - no matter what.
